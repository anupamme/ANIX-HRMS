  A modern Attendance, Leave and Workforce Management System for anix

  <em>Full-stack HRMS built with FastAPI + React</em>

## Overview

**anix HRMS** is a web-based Human Resource Management System purpose-built for anix
(an organization of employees — selfless service workers). It digitizes the complete
employee lifecycle, from onboarding a new employee to tracking daily attendance,
managing leave, and scaling employees up to Ashramites.

The system provides role-based dashboards for employees, HODs, HR admins, and
super admins, with geo-verified attendance, configurable leave policies,
week-off management, and secure document storage.

### Highlights

- **Geo-verified check-in / check-out** — attendance is tied to registered
  office locations with a configurable proximity threshold.
- **Multi-step leave approval** — employee → HOD → HR with half-day support,
  cancellation, and full audit trail.
- **Self-service onboarding** — new employees register, upload documents, and get
  activated via email links.
- **Cloud document vault** — ID proof, PAN card, bank passbook uploaded to
  Cloudflare R2, not the database.
- **Email-first communication** — Brevo (or SMTP) powers verification, password
  resets, leave notifications and reminders.
- **Attendance reminders** — an in-app background worker nudges employees who
  haven't marked attendance.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- Node.js 18+
- PostgreSQL (local instance or a cloud database)

### 1. Backend

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate          # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env               # fill in your values
alembic upgrade head               # run migrations
uvicorn app.main:app --reload      # API at http://localhost:8000
```

> API docs are available at <http://localhost:8000/docs> (Swagger UI).

### 2. Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local        # set VITE_API_BASE_URL if needed
npm run dev                       # app at http://localhost:5173
```

Vite proxies `/api` and `/static` to the backend at `127.0.0.1:8000`
automatically in development.

### Environment Variables (Backend)

The core variables (see `backend/.env.example`):

| Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `DATABASE_URL` | PostgreSQL connection string |
| `SECRET_KEY` | JWT signing secret |
| `FRONTEND_URL` | Public frontend URL (used in email links, CORS) |
| `STORAGE_PROVIDER` | `local` (dev) or `r2` (production) |
| `EMAIL_PROVIDER` | `smtp` or `brevo` |
| `BREVO_API_KEY` | Brevo API key for email delivery |
| `SMTP_*` | SMTP server settings when `EMAIL_PROVIDER=smtp` |
| `R2_*` | Cloudflare R2 bucket credentials |
| `ENVIRONMENT` | `development` or `production` |

### Environment Variables (Frontend)

| Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `VITE_API_BASE_URL` | Base URL of the backend API (empty in dev — uses proxy) |

---

## Running Tests

### Backend

```bash
cd backend
pytest
```

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm run lint
npm test
```

---

## Deployment

### Backend — Render

1. Push the repository to GitHub and create a new **Web Service** on Render.
2. Configure the service:

   | Setting | Value |
   | --- | --- |
   | **Root Directory** | `backend` |
   | **Build Command** | `pip install -r requirements.txt` |
   | **Start Command** | `uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT` |

3. Add the environment variables listed above (DATABASE_URL, SECRET_KEY,
   BREVO/R2 credentials, FRONTEND_URL, etc.).
4. Render handles `postgres://` → `postgresql://` URL normalization
   automatically in code — no env tweaks needed.

### Frontend — Cloudflare Pages

1. Connect the same GitHub repository as a new Pages project.
2. Configure the build:

   | Setting | Value |
   | --- | --- |
   | **Root Directory** | `frontend` |
   | **Build Command** | `npm run build` |
   | **Output Directory** | `dist` |

3. Set `VITE_API_BASE_URL` to the Render API URL (e.g. `https://your-api.onrender.com`).

> Full production notes (backups, rollback, smoke tests) are in
> [`docs/production-deployment.md`](docs/production-deployment.md).

## Local Network Access

To reach the app from another device on your LAN:

- Frontend already binds Vite to `0.0.0.0:5173` (`npm run dev`).
- Backend: run `python -m app.main` from `backend`, or set `HOST=0.0.0.0` and
  `PORT=8000` before launching uvicorn.
- For email links (verification/reset) to work from another device, set
  `FRONTEND_URL` in `backend/.env` to the LAN URL you actually use,
  e.g. `http://192.168.1.121:5173`.

---

## Backup & Maintenance

A script is included to back up PostgreSQL to Cloudflare R2:

```bash
python backend/scripts/backup_postgres_to_r2.py
```

Retention: 14 daily, 8 weekly and 12 monthly backups are kept automatically.
